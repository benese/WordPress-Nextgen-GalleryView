The jQuery GalleryView plugin for NextGen Gallery. No more breaking WordPress / jQuery with the CowTools SmoothGallery plugin.

== Description ==

**Nextgen GalleryView**: A Wordpress Plugin that allows you to use the jQuery GalleryView Plugin with your **NextGen-Gallery** galleries.

In order to use the GalleryView Plugin you kinda need to be using [NextGen Gallery](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/nextgen-gallery/). This is based heavily from the SmoothGallery plugin to create a much easier transition to on that doesn't break things.
